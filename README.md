This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:

Here's a draft for a README section on how to use `.env` files and generate builds for different environments in your React Native project:

---

## Environment Configuration

This project uses `.env` files to manage environment-specific configurations, such as API URLs, keys, and other variables that may differ between development, staging, and production environments.

### Setting Up Environment Variables

We use the `react-native-config` package (or `react-native-dotenv`) to manage environment variables.

1. **Create Environment Files:**

   Create separate `.env` files for each environment in the root directory of the project:

   - `.env.development` - Configuration for development environment.
   - `.env.staging` - Configuration for staging environment.
   - `.env.production` - Configuration for production environment.

   Each file should define the environment-specific variables in the following format:

   ```env
   API_URL=https://your-api-url.com
   API_KEY=your-api-key
   ```

   Example `.env.development`:

   ```env
   API_URL=https://dev-api.example.com
   API_KEY=dev-secret-key
   ```

2. **Using Environment Variables in Code:**

   You can import and use the environment variables in your React Native components as follows:

   ```javascript
   import Config from 'react-native-config';

   console.log('API URL:', Config.API_URL);
   ```

   Or, if using `react-native-dotenv`:

   ```javascript
   import {API_URL, API_KEY} from '@env';

   console.log('API URL:', API_URL);
   ```

### Generating Builds for Different Environments

To build and run the app with the appropriate environment configuration, specify the `.env` file when executing the build commands.

1. **Development Build:**

   To run the app in development mode using `.env.development`:

   ```bash
   ENVFILE=.env.development npx react-native run-android
   ENVFILE=.env.development npx react-native run-ios
   ```

2. **Staging Build:**

   To run the app in staging mode using `.env.staging`:

   ```bash
   ENVFILE=.env.staging npx react-native run-android
   ENVFILE=.env.staging npx react-native run-ios
   ```

3. **Production Build:**

   To run the app in production mode using `.env.production`:

   ```bash
   ENVFILE=.env.production npx react-native run-android
   ENVFILE=.env.production npx react-native run-ios
   ```

### Example npm Scripts

For convenience, you can add npm scripts to your `package.json` to automate the build process:

```json
"scripts": {
  "android:dev": "ENVFILE=.env.development react-native run-android",
  "android:staging": "ENVFILE=.env.staging react-native run-android",
  "android:prod": "ENVFILE=.env.production react-native run-android",
  "ios:dev": "ENVFILE=.env.development react-native run-ios",
  "ios:staging": "ENVFILE=.env.staging react-native run-ios",
  "ios:prod": "ENVFILE=.env.production react-native run-ios"
}
```

Now you can run the app with a specific environment by simply running one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run android:dev
npm run android:prod
npm run ios:dev
npm run ios:prod
```

### Notes

- Ensure that your `.env` files are listed in `.gitignore` to avoid committing sensitive information to the repository.
- If you add new environment variables, be sure to restart your development server for the changes to take effect.
- Dont push your actual .env files to github, the above .env files has been pushed for demo purpose

## Firebase Crashlytics Integration

This project uses Firebase Crashlytics to monitor app stability and track crashes. Follow the steps below to set up and integrate Firebase Crashlytics into the project.

### Prerequisites

Before integrating Firebase Crashlytics, ensure you have the following:

1. A Firebase project set up in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. The Firebase CLI installed on your machine.
3. The React Native Firebase modules installed in your project.

### Step 1: Set Up Firebase in the Project

1. **Create a Firebase Project:**

   - Visit the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Create a new Firebase project or select an existing one.

2. **Add Your App to Firebase:**
   - **For Android:**
     - Register your Android app with the package name found in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
     - Download the `google-services.json` file from Firebase and place it in the `android/app/` directory.
   - **For iOS:**
     - Register your iOS app with the bundle ID found in `ios/{YourProjectName}/Info.plist`.
     - Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file from Firebase and add it to your Xcode project, ensuring it is included in the project and target settings.

### Step 2: Install Firebase Crashlytics Dependencies

1. **Install React Native Firebase Modules:**

   ```bash
   npm install @react-native-firebase/app @react-native-firebase/crashlytics
   ```

2. **For iOS:**

   - Navigate to the `ios` directory and install the CocoaPods dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd ios
   pod install
   cd ..
   ```

### Step 3: Configure Firebase Crashlytics

#### Android Configuration

1. **Update `android/build.gradle`:**

   - Add the Firebase and Crashlytics classpaths:

   ```gradle
   buildscript {
       dependencies {
           classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.15'
           classpath 'com.google.firebase:firebase-crashlytics-gradle:2.9.8'
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Update `android/app/build.gradle`:**

   - Apply the Google services and Crashlytics plugins:

   ```gradle
   apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
   apply plugin: 'com.google.firebase.crashlytics'
   ```

   - Ensure the following dependencies are included:

   ```gradle
   dependencies {
       implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-crashlytics-ktx'
   }
   ```

3. **Enable ProGuard for Crashlytics (Optional):**

   - If using ProGuard, add these rules in `proguard-rules.pro`:

   ```pro
   -keepattributes SourceFile,LineNumberTable
   -keep class * { *; }
   -dontwarn okhttp3.**
   ```

#### iOS Configuration

1. **Update `Podfile`:**

   - Ensure the Firebase Crashlytics pod is included:

   ```ruby
   pod 'Firebase/Core'
   pod 'Firebase/Crashlytics'
   ```

2. **Add Run Script for Crashlytics:**

   - In Xcode, go to your project settings, navigate to `Build Phases`, and add a new "Run Script Phase" with the following script:

   ```bash
   "${PODS_ROOT}/FirebaseCrashlytics/run"
   ```

### Step 4: Initialize Crashlytics in React Native

1. **Enable Crashlytics in your App:**

   - Import and initialize Firebase Crashlytics in your app entry point (`index.js` or `App.js`):

   ```javascript
   import crashlytics from '@react-native-firebase/crashlytics';

   crashlytics().log('App started');
   ```

2. **Optional: Force a Test Crash**

   - You can force a test crash to ensure Crashlytics is properly configured:

   ```javascript
   crashlytics().crash();
   ```

### Step 5: Verify Integration

After running your app and triggering any crashes, check the Firebase Console under "Crashlytics" to verify that the crashes are reported correctly.

### Notes

- **Release vs. Debug:** Crashlytics typically logs data from release builds. Make sure to test with a release build for accurate results.
- **ProGuard/R8 Configuration:** Ensure your ProGuard/R8 settings are correctly configured to avoid issues with obfuscation.

By following these steps, you should have Firebase Crashlytics integrated and configured in your React Native project. This will help you monitor app stability and resolve issues more effectively.
